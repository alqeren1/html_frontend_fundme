# FundMe Frontend Practice

This repository is a basic HTML front-end practice project for interacting with the FundMe smart contract. It serves as a learning exercise for building web interfaces that communicate with blockchain applications.

## Overview

This simple project demonstrates how to create a web page that interacts with a smart contract on the blockchain. It includes:
- A single-page design with basic buttons for interaction.
- JavaScript files for connecting to Ethereum using the Ethers.js library.
- A constants file to store configuration variables.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:**  
  The main HTML file that lays out the basic structure and buttons for user interactions.

- **constants.js:**  
  Contains configuration variables such as contract addresses and network parameters.

- **ethers.js:**  
  Integrates the Ethers.js library for blockchain interactions.

- **scripts.js:**  
  Contains the JavaScript logic to interact with the FundMe smart contract (e.g., funding, retrieving contract data).

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and how to interact with Ethereum smart contracts.
- MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet browser extension to interact with the blockchain.
- An active internet connection for connecting to the blockchain network.

## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alqeren1/html_frontend_fundme.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd html_frontend_fundme
   ```

3. **Open the Webpage:**

   Open `index.html` in your web browser. Make sure your Ethereum wallet is connected and configured for the correct network.

## Learning Outcomes

This project was developed as a practice exercise to:
- Gain hands-on experience with creating a blockchain-enabled web interface.
- Understand the basics of interacting with smart contracts using Ethers.js.
- Learn how to structure and deploy simple front-end applications that connect to the Ethereum blockchain.
